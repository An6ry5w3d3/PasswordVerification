# PasswordVerification

This is a simple Python program that asks the user for a password and checks its length and the presence of characters in it to establish the complexity of the password. If the password does not meet the specified criteria, the program will return the password entry form until the password meets the criteria.

After successfully entering the password, the program displays a welcome message: "Welcome to the system" then ends.

This is my first program that I decided to implement on my own. You can throw tomatoes at the author for the uselessness of this program, but for the author this is the first step on the way to a dream.
